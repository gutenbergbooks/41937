<h2>Foreword</h2>


<div class='cap'>NOWADAYS, whenever we pick up
a magazine, we read the notices of
Camps all the way from Maine to
California, who are in need of Campers, and
think how very popular camping is becoming,
when as a matter of fact it is the one and only
pastime that has always retained its popularity.</div>

<p>We can trace it back to the prehistoric ages;
see it carved in hieroglyphics on obelisks, find
upon investigation that North, South, East
or West, the tribes of Red, Black, Yellow
and White, have gloried in living in tents, so
is it any wonder that mankind still loves it?</p>

<p>This thin veneer of civilization which makes
us desire to shut ourself in structures of brick
and wood is only skin deep. Right under
the surface the love for the open prevails so
strongly, that every little while a man who
has been brought up according to our standards
breaks loose, takes to the road and lives
a life of freedom, while the world looking on
pities him for going down in the scale and
tries to bring him back from the life his
nature craves, to one of humdrum existence.</p>

<p>Then come along with me, please, do, for
just one summer in Camp and you will say at
the end of the season that you can squeeze
more fun into a canvas tent than into all the
palaces you ever were in.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<h2>CAMPING</h2>




<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Getting Ready.</div>


<p>With the catalog and prospectus in
front of you, making delightful little
shivers run up and down your spine, you
begin marking down, first, the articles
you must have; then the things you hope
your fond relatives will give you; then
the clothes and athletic goods without
which any boy with true camping spirit
cannot get along.</p>

<p>Your father, who secretly expects to
come out to Camp and use some of your
cherished sweaters, running pants,
swimming trunks, etc., etc., suggests
that you get extra large sizes, to allow
for shrinkage. You protest, telling him
that you don't want your clothes to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
like "hand-me-downs," that you had inherited
from your big brother.</p>

<p>After many heart-breaking wrenches,
during which you feel as though even
death itself were preferable to giving up
all the articles you have chosen, you effect
a compromise by saying you will be
satisfied with one fishing rod, six pairs
of running pants, several pairs of sneakers,
lots of sweaters, a complete outfit
of oilskins, tennis racket, baseball bat,
balls, and Oh! what a good boy you
would be, if you could have a canoe.</p>

<p>You would study all winter, not want
to stay up late, cross your heart to leave
cigarettes and trashy novels alone, but,
gee whiz! only to be the owner of a
canoe. You even appeal to your father,
who weighs in the neighborhood of 200
pounds, and try to make him see the fun
of going out with you.   Suppose you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
were upset? What of it? You can
both swim.</p>

<p>Mother, dear, puts a quick veto on
that. No canoe for you at any price.
In fact, owing to her nervous system
being in need of recuperation, she thinks
the bath tub the best place to swim in,
and deplores the risks one must take in
order to be athletic.</p>

<p>The 'House' having vetoed the canoe
question, you offer another little bill,
asking for an appropriation for a shotgun,
or at least one of those dandy little
air rifles, so you can shoot at targets and
the farmers' cows and chickens.</p>

<p>Before you can be heard the 'House'
vetoes that, too. Danger signals are
displayed, and you feel as though you
were treading on a third rail.</p>

<p>The 'House' suggests that you should
spend the summer with her, taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
views with your Kodak, walking miles
every day and playing ping pong and
lotto every evening, thus getting a nice
quiet rest to prepare you for a long winter's
study.</p>

<p>In the deepest despair you clutch your
father's hand. He gives you a sympathetic
squeeze in return. Say, is there
anything on the face of this earth like
the loving freemasonry between a sporty
parent and his little son?</p>

<p>Not to agitate matters any more and
change the subject, you ask how much
pocket money you are to be allowed per
week. The 'House' again rises to object,
claiming that, as there are no car fares
to be paid or soda fountains to tempt,
you cannot have any possible use for
money. You will be furnished with
plenty of paper and stamped envelopes
and sundries, thus for once relieving you
of the strain of handling money.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, whoever heard of a right little,
tight little boy who objected to the jingle
of loose change in his pants pockets?
"If such there be, go mark him well,"
for he surely will need watching.</p>

<p>From data you have gathered, you inform
the 'House' that a camel with three
stomachs isn't in it with a hungry boy
at Camp; that your special friends, Jack,
Ed, and Fatty, all spend their weekly
money, and that nothing but the fear of
being punished keeps them from gnawing
the canvas tents. They live in the
open all the time and are constantly
hungry.</p>

<p>Just about the time when one feels
that hunger laughs at locksmiths, the
ice cream and cake man drives in. If
you have ever in your travels seen a
horde of hungry little piglings swarm
all over a trough you can form some idea
of what those boys do to that wagon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
The boys are simply starving for ice
cream and cake. One plate is only an
introduction; with the second one you
begin to distinguish the flavor; it really
needs a third one to put that sweet icy
feeling in your stomach so earnestly desired
by the growing youth. The next
day, or maybe next but one, our friend
the fruit man calls. All your life you
have been told of the value of fruit.
Your system at this time craves lots of
it. It is very good for you. Oh! yes,
certainly! but it has to be paid for from
some of that pocket money. All this
and more you tell them, being careful
to cross your t's and dot your i's for
fear of the 'House's' objections.</p>

<p>Father and mother decide to consult
together. You see the moment has arrived,
when you will gain more by saying
less, so you kiss them good-night
and "stand not upon the order of your
going."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Upstairs you fall into a brown study.
With your clothes half off, you think of
the fun you will have; perhaps of the
medals you will win, and there creeps
just a little undercurrent of sadness
through you at the thought of parting
from your devoted parents. "Ah, me!
I kind of hate to leave mother," you
think, then console yourself that they
will be coming up to see you. About
this time your day dream ends suddenly,
for they are coming upstairs. Out goes
the light. Into bed you jump. Are
asleep in the twinkling of an eye, to
dream that you are at Camp, enjoying
all the fun and frolic there.</p>

<p>The minute you open your eyes in the
morning you read the catalog from beginning
to end, look at the pictures, try
to fancy yourself posing as the champion
high diver, jumper and tennis player,
and forget to brush your teeth, in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
hurry to get to school, where you can
consult with your chums.</p>

<p>Not one sporting goods window can
you pass without a curious glance. In
fact, dear boy, you are in such a maze
that when the teacher asks you to tell
him how you would start for the North
Pole you answer promptly: "From the
Grand Central Station, on the Bar Harbor
Express," and, for the life of you,
cannot see why the class roars at you.</p>

<p>Some weeks never seem to come to an
end, and this, the very longest week of
your life, just crawls away. Saturday
your fond father has promised to go
with you and purchase the athletic
goods, while mother attends to the rest.</p>

<p>You want to know where he is going
to buy them and what he is going to get.
Are told to come along and not fuss any
more. If there is any smell on the face
of this earth that smells nicer than new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
leather in an athletic goods shop, I want
to smell it. Oh, me! Oh, my! what
beauties, and you have to bite your
tongue to keep from interrupting.</p>

<p>Business has been very good with
father, and he, thinking back over his
own boyhood, when money was as
scarce as hens' teeth, makes up his mind
to fit you out so as to be a credit to yourself
and him.</p>

<p>Later in life you may blossom out in
a Prince Albert and silk hat, a dinner or
full dress suit, but never, as long as you
live, will clothes ever give you the unalloyed
pleasure that these camping togs
do in your first year at Camp.</p>

<p>As a rule, you are not over and above
fond of carrying bundles. The cook can
vouch for that. How much bribery she
had to practice to make you bring home
quickly a bottle of milk or of water or a
bunch of soup greens. But now you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
are perfectly willing to carry everything
from sneakers to caps, and can hardly
trust the salesman to send them home.</p>

<p>In the privacy of your room you strip
off your clothes in a jiffy, for the joy of
trying on the different sweaters, running
pants and swimming trunks. In
your baseball clothes you pose, in fancy,
almost a miniature Mathewson; try a
high dive from the bureau to the bed;
do a hurdle over the towel rack. Nothing
but the fear of breaking the furniture
stops you in your wild gambols.</p>

<p>Another peep at the catalog to see if
you have everything you need; a fervent
hope that you may make good, and bring
home with you in the fall a silver cup or
trophy. Then, carefully folding each
and every garment with almost reverent
care, you vow to keep your trunk in order.
If any one should mention the fact
to you, you would be indignant at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
idea of not caring a jot at the end of the
season whether you collected your belongings
or left them lying around loose.</p>

<p>Among the gifts you have thus far
received are a compass, a kodak and a
housewife filled with thread, needles,
buttons, etc. There does not seem to
be one thing wanting to make life one
long, sweet song unless it is the canoe
which you hope for next year. All
through life that one little thing which
would make us perfectly happy, if we
had it, and yet the perfect happiness is
not for mortals. Truly, the poet knew
what he was talking about when he said,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is our destined end or way;</span><br />
But to act, that each to-morrow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Find us farther than to-day."</span><br />

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Leaving the City.</div>


<p>A few days before we leave for Camp
all the boys, new and old, are invited to
meet at the home of the Director to become
acquainted with one another. It
is called a rally, and truly the boys do
rally around the Director, whose greatest
fault is that he loves mankind too
much, for his idea of Heaven is that it
is filled with boys alone. One look in
his face will convince the most skeptical,
and association for even a brief season
with him makes a boy feel truer and
better.</p>

<p>The principal part of the rally consists
of partaking bountifully of ice cream,
cake and lemonade, while exchanging
yarns with old friends, making new acquaintances,
thinking up new jokes, and
enjoying the shining hours. The faculty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
hobnob with each other, and, taking
it altogether, it is a delightful afternoon,
one to be remembered as a red letter
day.</p>

<p>Even the old Camp nurse calls around,
to be greeted by both her friends and
enemies; to renew her friendship for all,
mentally picking out new favorites, while
keeping a warm spot in her heart for
old boys. There is something in the air
that starts her off right away using
camp slanguage, and behaving like one
of the boys. She just cannot help getting
into the spirit of the thing. All the
way over to the rally she had told herself
that she must act in a dignified way
becoming to a woman of 80 in the shade,
then the minute she catches sight of the
crowd she throws dignity to the winds,
saying she'll none of it, is ready for a
tussle with or without gloves, snaps her
fingers at old Father Time. Let the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
sands run down if they must, but until
the last grain has run, she hopes to be
with her boys, to tease, to love, to try
and care for them. If they need a mother's
care, all right; she is there. Are
they in want of a chum? Well, in a
pinch she will do. As long as she can
make them happy in her poor little way,
what cares she if she does make a goose
of herself?</p>

<p>You see that, after all, the keynote of
life is LOVE. With it, the very poorest
home is happy; without it, a palace
is dreary. So poor old Nursie starts out
by loving the Director, and right on
down the line, finding good qualities in
the worst and tamest boy there. She
is devoutly thankful for the chance to
spend some weeks with those who love
her, despite her years and looks.</p>

<p>But we must not get mushy. So let's
travel along and get to the starting
point, or how shall we ever get there?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The day before we leave New York
the expressman calls for our trunks,
bags, etc., which ends our troubles as
far as they are concerned. We never
see anything of them until we get to
Camp, yet they have been on their way
just the same as we. There they stand
on the Campus, waiting to be put into the
tents. They are filled with good things
to decorate and make these little homes
look like college rooms.</p>

<p>The long-looked-for day is here at last.
A farewell look around to see that we
have forgotten nothing, we make a solemn
promise to write regularly, to keep
our teeth clean, not to eat much trash,
to keep out of danger, not to get wet,
to mind the Director and faculty; in
fact, to be good, good, good.</p>

<p>Compared to the excitement at the
depot, the Tower of Babel was a peaceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
village. Of course, it is a fool comparison
to compare the anxious parents'
wanderings to that of a lot of hens who
have just been decapitated, yet they will
feel so terribly anxious at the parting
moment. Every mother wants her boy
looked after, never mind the rest. The
boy himself doesn't want to be fussed
over, and most awfully hates to be petted
in public.</p>

<p>Yes, sir! I have known boys who
would kick at being petted in public, and
yet were perfectly willing to have some
one lie down with them at night, telling
them fairy stories until they were sleepy.
They never entirely get over that, either,
only the tables are reversed in later
years, they being the ones to tell the
fairy stories.</p>

<p>The gates are opened; one wild rush
for the cars; mothers kissing the wrong
boys in their excitement; everybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
trying to get away from somebody else,
the inevitable small boy with fiendish
cunning letting go of your hand, shouts,
laughter, tears and prayers, follow us
as we step aboard the special train reserved
for our Camp, "Good-bye, dear&mdash;Be
a good boy&mdash;Write soon&mdash;Clean your
teeth&mdash;Don't poke your head out of the
window&mdash;Tell the Nurse about your
medicine&mdash;Tell the faculty about your
clothes&mdash;Ask the doctor to keep an eye
on you&mdash;Let the Director 'phone me as
soon as you get there"&mdash;these, and a
thousand and one more questions and
orders, follow us as we slowly glide out
of the train shed.</p>

<p>We soothe the nervous parents, honestly
promising them to look after
their darlings, send them home with
sometimes a heavy heart at the thought
of parting from their children, yet thankful
that they can give them advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
that they themselves could not always
have in their youth. There are, of
course, exceptions; many a father realizes
that he has not the knack of training
his boys and being wise, decides to let
others do it for him. For what on earth
is sadder than parent and child who do
not understand each other, constantly
pulling at the wrong end of the rope,
growing farther and farther apart as the
years go by.</p>

<p>Before the train is in the tunnel the
little chaps are peeling off their collars,
ties and all the clothes they dare, having
been almost roasted, that hot June evening,
before starting.</p>

<p>The porter is ordered to make up
berths at once. You really would think
they wanted to go to bed. It looks that
way for a minute, but is only a huge
bluff. While ample room has been allowed
for all, the rascals prefer getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
into each other's berths. Only the very
little boys go to sleep before 10 or 11
p. m. Such a glorious time as they have!
But even the wildest boy must let
up some time until his storage batteries
are recharged. At last quiet prevails,
and for the next few hours nothing is
heard but the click of the rails, the
warning whistle, the brakeman passing
through the cars with shining lantern,
one or another of the faculty seeing that
all's well, our Director himself looking
out for the comfort of the little ones.</p>

<p>Biddy herself, on the job, like the old
woman of nursery rhyme who had so
many children she didn't know what to
do, is put down at one end of the car with
all the littlest ones. These she can
watch (when she's awake), and gather
under her wings in case of storm. There
is no storm, unless one of protest at the
general racket made.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a><br /><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>On the Way to Camp.</div>


<p>The night passes at last. With the
first streak of daylight boys jump up
and dress quickly, for we are due at
Portland a little after 7 a. m.</p>

<p>Our breakfast has been ordered ahead.
All we have to do is to eat it, not like the
famous recipe for cooking a hare; ours
has been caught, skinned and cooked.
It seems to fill the bill, for with good
appetite we fall to, causing even the
waiters, who are used to almost everything,
to gasp at the way the food disappears.</p>

<p>About half an hour is allowed us at
the station. Then "All aboard" for Oxford.
What a beautiful country we are
passing through! The late spring here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
makes everything look beautifully tender
and green; rolling country, which,
after all, is the perfect landscape, passes
before us. After the heat and dust of
the city, how cool and refreshing this
is! Comfortable farm houses, lovely
orchards, with the trees heavy with
young fruit, winding streams, songbirds
on every side, overhead a sky of tenderest
blue, with here and there a fleck of
white&mdash;even the cattle grazing in the
fields seem to know that we are coming,
for they low, and the calves run along
the inside of the fence seeming to recognize
kindred spirits. Through this most
beautiful section of country we ride for
one and one-half hours, stopping at Oxford.</p>

<p>Carriages are waiting for the 6-mile
ride to Camp. We thought Nature in
her most lavish mood had shown us the
best she had while we were on the train,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
but here were more and more surprises
in store for us. Were you to take a little
of Lake George, mix it with some
shady lanes in England, add the clear
atmosphere of the Catskills, sprinkle
around a few of the prettiest lakes in
Switzerland, borrow the Italian skies for
a covering, even then, Maine, in this section,
can give the rest of the country
cards and spades and beat them at that.</p>

<p>We are really very glad, though, when
we come in sight of Camp. Even the
loveliest drive won't satisfy a boy who is
anxious to get to his tent. He wants to
get out of his city clothes, and into
Camp attire. What a beautiful scene
opens before us! The lake, like a sheet
of polished silver, rows of tents waiting
for tenants, the tables already set for
dinner, all the house help on hand smiling
a welcome, and willing to make
every one feel quickly at home.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Wagon after wagon drives up and discharges
its load of living freight. They
climb out any way, over the back, over
the dashboard, over the wheels, the
farmers threatening to sue for damages
for injuries inflicted upon their ancient
turnouts.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a><br /><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>First Day in Camp.</div>


<p>Before we can locate ourselves the bugle
sounds for mess. Each of the instructors
has a certain number of boys
in his care, so there is not the slightest
confusion.</p>

<p>There is not a roof garden or a palm
room or any other make-believe place for
eating outdoors in the city that can compare
with this. To eat out-of-doors with
such air, such views, such food! Those
who are hungry pitch right in; those
with little appetite begin to eat, gaining
a love for the food as they go along. Second
helpings of everything are called for
and eaten, until at last the waistband
protests at such pressure being put upon
it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the signal is given to leave
the table every boy takes quick advantage
of it. We see them, running here
and there, looking for their bags and
boxes. For the next few hours they are
as busy as the proverbial bee.</p>

<p>Boys, who, when at home, have not
even as much as taken their changes of
linen out of the bureau, who since
infancy have been washed, combed,
brushed and dressed by fond mothers
and nurses, here learn for the first time
what it is to do for themselves.</p>

<p>It is a joyful revelation to them to find
out how much they can do. Heretofore
they have not only been willing to let
others do for them but have demanded
it; now, when they need a bath, there is
no one to prepare it for them, so they
just go ahead and gather their belongings
together and run down to the lake.
No shutting of windows and taking a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
bath in a torrid temperature, with some
one handy to rub your back, following
that with an alcohol rub. I guess not.
You go into water that sparkles, slop
around if you cannot swim; swim around
if you cannot slop. The water just
soaks out all the impurities. Then out
you jump. Sometimes you dry with a
towel, most of the time the sun dries
you, and of all the lovely towels on the
face of this earth the pleasant sunshine,
woven with gentle breezes, is the one
and only towel for me.</p>

<p>In the city a chap just hurries into the
water, soaps the washrag, debates, if he
is in a hurry, whether to wash from head
to foot or just touch the dirty places
lightly and depend upon the towel to do
the rest. Sometimes he sits down in the
tub and doesn't wash at all; just sits
there, thinking, like a bump on a log,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
until he is warned of the flight of time;
then jumps out again, not half clean.</p>

<p>But at Camp the joy of going into the
water is doubled, nay, trebled, by the
knowledge that you cannot go in when
you want to, but must wait until the
proper hour; and this, our first day
there, is about the middle of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Most of us fancy we can swim well
until we go into a large body of water.
There is all the difference in the world
between making a fast sprint in a tank,
under cover, with no currents or wind
or shoaling water to impede one's movements.
That is why so many boys have
to find out for themselves the difference.
Many boys who have held records for
indoor swimming make rather poor
showing when it comes to long-distance
swimming in the open.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Our first afternoon at Camp passes
so quickly that before you can say Jack
Robinson it is time for supper. We
have not done one-quarter of the self-imposed
tasks. How can a fellow do
much when he just has to stop every few
seconds to look out of his tent? The
water allures with its sparkle, the woods
invite you to come and rest in their
shade; the Campus begs for your company;
baseball diamonds plead for just
one game; tennis courts spread their
nets to catch the player; basketball
courts coax with their goals on high;
the running track dares you to sprint
just once around. What, with flags
floating, sun shining, life and animation
everywhere, is it any wonder that supper
time finds us this day with happiness
in our hearts, trunks upset, tents
half decorated, letters to parents begun,
everything started and nothing finished?
On this, our first day, there is not one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
boy in a hundred who could put his share
of the tent in order.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the Kodak fiend.
How can he bother with such things as
arranging his toilet articles, when the
sun is just right for snapping a few
views? He surely can put his share in
order when the shadows begin to fall.
He uses up a roll of films without much
result, because in his hurry to snapshot
the entire country in one afternoon he
makes mistakes. Later on he will discriminate,
to his advantage, and by the
end of the season show some pictures
worth while.</p>

<p>Then there is the boy who has brought
his musical instrument along to Camp.
No matter whether it is a mandolin or a
guitar, a violin or a drum, a banjo or
jewsharp, it is an instrument, isn't it?
sometimes of pleasure, most of the time
of torture to the sensitive nerves, still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
with the best of intentions he tightens
the keys, looks up at the ridge pole for
inspiration and lets her go. He may
play some selection from Beethoven or
Chopin in a way to touch one's heart,
causing work to cease while he plays.
Then again it may be ragtime played out
of time and tune, making one's fingers
itch to slap him and destroy his musical
instrument; but, no matter what it is,
it is done for pleasure, and is accepted as
such by his admiring tentmates.</p>

<p>So much for art and music. Then
there is the boy who is anxious to start
a game. That chap is to be really pitied.
No matter how many times he puts the
bat in the corner of his tent it has a
sneaking way of rolling back again to
his feet. Could it speak, it would probably,
in a wooden sort of voice, ask what
he had brought it along for. No bat
with a bit of self-respecting feeling in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
its wooden heart likes to look new. It
feels that its chief charm is to be useful
more than ornamental, and if you are at
all doubtful about the sympathetic feeling
between a baseball bat and a good
player, then just go to any one of the
good games and watch the batters.
Many a time have I been amused at their
antics. They take up an apparently respectable
old bat, swing it around, feel
its weight, hit the ground with it, and
just when you think that the bat in self-defense
will swat them one they throw
it down in disgust. The bat often rolls
back again, asking for another trial. Has
it not been created for just this kind of
work? Then what right has a man to
throw it down without a trial?</p>

<p>To an outsider there seems to be madness
in their methods. Yet it may be
the reverse, just as some people are created
for one special line of work, so may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
even a piece of wood be better fitted to
form a plank that stays in one place,
while another piece of wood has so much
life in it, whether you will or not, if
you use that particular bat you are
bound to win.</p>

<p>But for all-round madness, commend
me to the tennis player. He is hopeless
from the start, and all he knows about
love is what he wins in the game. They
will go without meals, play at all hours,
and are as greedy as can be about holding
on to courts. Yet tennis could be
made a sentimental game. What with
its couples, playing for love and courts,
and nets, Cupid himself might take a
hand in arranging the matches.</p>

<p>Well, the tennis fiend goes out,
whether it is hot or cold, that first afternoon,
finds a partner, runs, jumps and
leaps all afternoon after two little white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
balls, with never a care as to whether
his share of the tent is in order or not.</p>

<p>That is baseball and tennis for you,
gentle reader.</p>

<p>Next, on this our first day, there is the
boy who wants a boat and the boy who
wants a swim.</p>

<p>No wonder poets have made verses
about boating since time first was. Talk
about the poetry of motion! To lie in
the bottom of a roomy boat on a still
lake on a sunny afternoon, the water
lapping the sides in a gentle, soothing
way, making us think of our mothers
when they held us on their laps, just
rocking so slowly and easily that we
felt as if we cuddled up to her, her arms
tight around us (as though to ward off
all evil), and our head leaning on her
breast, that heaven itself could offer
nothing sweeter than this&mdash;indeed, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
one had one's choice between being a
little cherub a la Raphael, with cunning
wings growing out of his shoulder
blades, or just sitting on mother's lap
and being loved, I rather think heaven
would be short of cherubs, while every
mother's lap would be filled.</p>

<p>Then why call a boy lazy who likes to
lie idly in a boat, with his face turned
up to the blue heavens? He probably
is planning wonderful things to do when
he grows up; in the meantime feeling an
echo of the past, stirring his inmost being.</p>

<p>But of all the villains, the boy who
wants a swim is the worst. He will do
you the honor to ask for it, and is perfectly
happy if you grant permission.
He is evidently descended from some
one of the original fishes who went into
Noah's Ark. His nature craves water.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Long living on shore has rid his skin
of any scaly look, but the fish blood is
there just the same. He can dive to the
bottom of the pool and stay there looking
up at you with glassy eyes, for all
the world like a sulky trout. When he
leaps in the water you are reminded of
a porpoise splashing through the foam
at the vessel's bow. Again cutting
through the water, half-submerged, how
like a shark chasing its prey, this may
consist of some harmless old female,
who is gently ambling along. The first
thing she knows some monster of the
deep has grabbed her by the leg and is
dragging her under water. She shrieks
as in her struggles she fancies some
dread sea monster is taking her to its
lair. With almost superhuman effort
she breaks loose, when the monster
arises to laugh at her fright. It is the
born swimmer, the descendant of prehistoric
fishes, and the worst punishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
you can give him is to keep him
out of the water.</p>

<p>So much for the boatman and swimmer.
By supper time most of the boys
have laid the foundation for an elegant
coat of tan, some will be badly sunburnt
by to-morrow, for Old Sol dearly loves
to scorch the tender skin of the city
youth. It is useless to warn them about
stripping all their clothes off too soon.
How are they going to get a good coat
of tan on by the end of the season if they
don't begin right away? The only thing
to do is to put plenty of oil on, and if
"pain still treads on the heels of pleasure"
they will learn the wisdom of making
haste slowly.</p>

<p>We have a delightful supper. All of
the boys do ample justice to it. Afterwards
they lounge around for a short
period, when again the bugle blows
"Quarters."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Getting undressed in a tent with three
other boys is lots of fun. There is no
clothes closet to hang your clothes in,
just a line made of rope or wire stretched
across that serves as a clothes horse.
The night is cool, and both front and
back flaps of the tent are wide open to
the breezes. Just half an hour is allowed
to prepare for bed. Then the
bugler sounds "Taps," the most beautiful
call of all. Lights go out and silence
reigns. Here and there laughter may
be heard, but the majority of the boys
are so tired that their heads have hardly
touched the pillows before they are
asleep, after one of the longest and happiest
days of their lives.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a><br /><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Routine.</div>


<p>Bright and early the next morning
the bugler sounds reveille. Every one
jumps out of bed, although a few have
already been up since daylight, so eager
are they to be real Campers.</p>

<p>As soon as every one is out of bed the
setting up exercises take place. For
fifteen minutes the boys, under the leadership
of the instructors, go through a
course of calisthenics, after which they
go down to the water for a scrub and
plunge, brush their teeth and get their
clothes on. By that time the bugle calls
to them to get into line, ready to march
to the table for breakfast.</p>

<p>All who are not on line-in will find
themselves marching round the Campus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
which is a block square, several
times. Good exercise for them, at the
same time teaching them the truth about
"Time and tide waiting for no man."</p>

<p>Another good meal awaits us, plenty
of good, substantial food, that will put
strength into us and at the same time
tickle our palate.</p>

<p>After breakfast we find that it is not
all play at Camp. Some are inclined to
loaf; some would like to wander around;
others, with some definite object in view,
plan to go out for practice runs or
games. But, hold on, noble youths, you
have slept in your beds, have you not?
Well, like Mr. Squeers' method, we will
ask you to spell "bed," then go and make
it up. Also you have upset your tents.
Again, you are given gracious permission
to tidy them also.</p>

<p>Here we have no willing mothers, no
handy chambermaids, to put everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
in apple-pie order. This is truly Camp,
and you are simply soldiers Camping.</p>

<p>The Director may have an orderly to
do his work, but, as for the rest of the
Campers, it is every man for himself,
from the instructors down to the smallest
boy. Each and every one must do
his share. Beds are made, tents swept
out, clothes hung up, and when the bugle
again calls "Inspection" each and
every boy must be at his tent.</p>

<p>The Director, accompanied by his
staff, inspects, marking for and against
each tent. Accordingly, there is keen
competition between the boys to see who
has the most orderly tent for the season.
Prizes are awarded to the tent that has
the best record. All this conduces to
neat habits, and lets the boys see there
is more to be gained by doing the right
than the wrong thing.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Again the bugle calls for "Assembly."
This is one of the most interesting
events of the day. Here we can all sit
under the shade of beautiful trees and
listen to the orders being given out; the
schedule of the games to be played; the
list of those to be punished for breaking
the rules, etc., etc. On this occasion the
bad boy, knowing full well that he has
been marked for punishment and is going
to get it anyway, does a little more
to amuse his friends while he annoys
those in office.</p>

<p>As soon as the orders are given the
boys are dismissed, some to go on the
field for a game of tennis, others for
baseball, others for walking trips. For
the little boys there is tether ball and the
junior baseball diamond. In fact, whatever
is for the big boys is good for his
little brothers, excepting football.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>In the midst of the fun we hear the
bugle again. That is the swimming
call; so hurry with your bats, tennis
rackets and any other thing you may
be doing at this particular moment. Get
your swimming trunks and rush down
to the dock.</p>

<p>Now for fun. Those who can swim,
how gracefully they dive in, swim under
water, and just when your heart is
in your mouth for fear they are drowned
up they come in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The boys who are not very good
swimmers make up for skill by lots of
splashing about in the shallow water.
They duck each other, try to float, and
act for all the world like a school of
young porpoises. I myself like to go
out with them. They take me for a
friendly old mother whale and climb all
over me, never so happy as when they
get me down under the water. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
sometimes I take a large, roomy boat,
invite them in and pole them around the
lake to their enjoyment and my own,
too.</p>

<p>But this chapter tells of routine, so
we must obey the whistle when it blows.
That means all out, and any one caught
in after that is kept out for two or three
times&mdash;about the worst kind of punishment
you could give a boy.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the boys have very little
dressing to do, a pair of running pants
and a pair of sneakers being considered
full dress. Long before the bugle tells
them to form in line they are ready and
hungry.</p>

<p>This ends the morning. We have
been warned to write home to parents,
but the study period after dinner is the
time appointed for that. After a bountiful
dinner we see them prepared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
write. The big boy will write willingly
to some of his folks and loves to write
to the girls. He does not have to be
reminded that Wednesday and Sunday
are letter writing days. The middle
sized chap needs a little urging, but the
little bear is the one who forgets. He
may be so homesick that you dare hardly
speak to him on that subject, yet he
has to be forced to write regularly.</p>

<p>There are exceptions, of course. Take
little Jimsey, for instance, whom I found
crying. The minute I looked at him I
knew right away what kind of malady
he was afflicted with. Says I to him:
"Jimsey, old boy, have you written home
to your family yet?" "No," he answered,
"I don't know how to spell all
the words right. You see, I have never
been away from home before and never
had to write letters to my mother." "Oh,
if that's all that ails you, I am the boss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
letter writer. So, come along with me,
young man, and you can dictate and I
will write." "Can I do that?" he wanted
to know. "Of course you can. The
Director will say it is all right." And
this is what Jimsey wrote to his mother,
at least he dictated and I wrote it:</p>

<div class='blockquot'>"Dear Mother, Darling:<br />

<p>"We are here, and I am happy, but so
homesick to see you. Do you feel homesick
to see me? Let me know. I never
thought the world was such a big, lonely
place. Is it because you are not with
me to hold my hand? I am going to
be brave and bite my under lip, and as
Biddy says 'Keep a stiff upper lip.' She
says half the real truly battles in life
have been won by folks keeping up their
courage. I don't want to come home,
but, mother, if you are passing this way,
won't you stop in for a little while?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"By that time I shall be cured of this
complaint. Biddy says its called himevay.
It makes you feel weepy all the
time, and when night comes and the
lights are out that is the time you feel
it the worst. Mother, dear, don't pet
little brother too much, because he will
miss it like I do when he comes to
Camp. I know he is only a little boy
now, but if you had stopped petting me
when I was three months old I should
have got used to it by now and not miss
you so much.</p>

<p>"If I was not so lonely I could tell you
about this lovely place, but I have such
a lot to tell you of how I feel. Biddy
says I might just as well make this a
purely personal letter and get the whole
thing out of my system. That, she said,
would leave me the rest of the season
to describe the other things.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"When the lights are out and from
my cot bed I look out of the tent I can
see the sky. The moon is way up high,
and lots of little stars are shining. Is it
the same moon you can see from your
window? I hope it is, because you can
wish to see me when you look up and I
will wish to see you. Then there are so
many funny noises. The water seems
to be creeping up the shore a little way,
then falls back again. What makes it
do that, mother? Then some little baby
birds keep calling for their mother bird,
'Peep, peep, peep,' just like that. Are
they cold, do you think, or are they
afraid of falling out of the tree?</p>

<p>"Then all sorts of funny little insects
keep flying through the tents. Two or
three have little lights in their stomachs,
because I saw them. They came and
crawled over my netting and the light
went out, then in again. Wouldn't it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
be lovely if we could light our own way
like that?</p>

<p>"Give father a great, big hug and tell
him his big boy is trying to be a man.
Kiss little brother for me, and don't hold
his hand any more or he will get so used
to it. Biddy says if I want to sleep in
her room I can, and then I won't be
alone. Well, I will try it in the tent to-night,
because if you are going to keep
a brave front you have got to do it now.
Good-bye, mother, darling. I kiss your
photo every night. Write soon to your
lonely little boy,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JIMSEY."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Afternoon Sports.</div>


<p>After the study period is over the
teams go up to the baseball field for a
few games. What exciting times they
do have! The boys are divided, and for
the sake of sport given colors. So instead
of New York and Chicago it is the
Red and the Blue.</p>

<p>Thus early in the season they are only
friendly games. It is only later in the
season, when the trophy and cups are to
be fought for, that they play with all
their heart and soul.</p>

<p>Now it is fun, fast and furious, to see
which side is the strongest. Those who
are not playing sit around, cheering or
jeering as the case may be. It is all
good, healthy sport, and again when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
bugle blows for swimming they are
ready.</p>

<p>What a rush for towels. The water
is a little cooler this afternoon than this
morning, but when one has exercised so
vigorously it seems just right.</p>

<p>Courage comes to the timid. They
strike out into deeper water, find that
it is friendly to them, and begin to do
fancy strokes.</p>

<p>The good swimmers have started a
race with other experts. They mean to
swim to the island opposite without any
stopover, and are watched by an admiring
crowd of youngsters.</p>

<p>Care is taken that no boy goes beyond
his depth unless he is a good swimmer.
Instructors, in boats, constantly patrol
the course, watching every move the
boys make.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Well do I remember a funny incident
that happened to a visitor last summer.
He was a grown man, who said he had
been swimming in the Bay of Fundy.
As a starter he went in where the little
shavers go, and, mark you, in about four
feet of water, he went down. One of
the faculty, who was watching the boys,
saw him disappear. He jumped overboard
with his cigar still in his mouth,
dived under, brought him up, climbed
back into his boat, and calmly went on
smoking, leaving the Bay of Fundy hero
to wade out.</p>

<p>Some of the boys prefer a short swim,
then a row; others just spend the entire
time on the chutes, sliding down, either
head first or feet first, diving, splashing
and climbing back to the float, to do it
all over again, looking like a lot of
Greek gods in their scanty swimming
trunks.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>How careful one is in the city about
covering up the body quickly for fear of
taking cold! Out here the greatest
pleasure is after the swim to be in the
air and let the sun and wind dry and
toughen one. No chill, no cold, just a
pleasant glow. Any boy who does this
day after day cannot take a cold if he
tried to all winter. He is immune from
the nasty colds that beset one in this
changeable climate.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that the boys love
to be in Camp, where they can strip and
get close to Nature?</p>

<p>I have often wondered what Heaven
is like, and think it must at least have
most beautiful rivers, and flowing
streams, where one can bathe.</p>

<p>That is my idea of what Paradise
ought to be. Of course, there could be
a whole lot of things up there that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
have wanted so badly on this earth and
could not get, yet for me, the blessed
privilege of bathing and swimming in
waters pure is celestial.</p>

<p>Maybe the Lord in His goodness took
a little bit out of Heaven and planted it
in the State of Maine. For where will
you go, in this country, outside of that
State, and find such a harmonious blending
of climate, temperature, water, land,
sky and sea as we find there?</p>

<p>But while I am rhapsodizing on the
beauties of this State, let me not forget
that time flies, and again the bugle
sounds the call, "All out."</p>

<p>This time the boys are willing to dress
quietly, and spend the next hour resting
up after the many duties and pleasures
of the day.</p>

<p>There is only a short period between
the time we leave the water and the call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
for supper. When the first call sounds
every boy jumps up without a second
invitation from the faculty to get into
line.</p>

<p>The signal is again given. The line
turns right about face, marches to the
stirring music of fife and drum, keeping
time and forming one of the pleasantest
sights we have to show to our visitors.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Evening Games.</div>


<p>After supper sometimes the porch is
cleared for a friendly boxing match or
wrestling bout. The boys are chosen
who in size and strength are pretty well
matched.</p>

<p>There is a well-padded mat, and if
the wrestlers stand up first they are
stripped. The referee reads the rules to
them. They are cautioned against any
foul or losing their tempers, and then,
at the signal, turned loose.</p>

<p>Do they wrestle? Do they tussle?
Do they struggle with might and main
to put one another down? You try to
find out whether they are wrestling according
to Graeco-Roman methods or
catch-as-catch-can, and decide it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
be a mixture of both. After a spirited
round time is called. Each of them
goes to his corner to be fanned in a
strictly professional way by his seconds.</p>

<p>After one minute's rest they are at it
again hammer and tongs, give and take,
like two old-timers, all over the mat,
first one, then the other having the advantage.
They begin to show signs of
being winded, so the referee blows his
whistle, and again they repair to their
respective corners.</p>

<p>After another minute's rest they stand
forth for the final round. In this you
see some mighty pretty holds. Were
they stronger men probably they would
be throwing each other over their shoulders,
but, being boys, they can't do that.
The last round is declared a draw, and
as each won one of the other rounds,
there is a happy shaking of hands as
they go back to their friends.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>The next bout being between larger
boys, is more interesting. Here we see
two splendid types of young manhood.
They stand on the mat measuring each
other with their eyes, planning just
where to take hold, when the whistle
blows to begin.</p>

<p>The referee reads the rules to them,
lets them clearly understand that he
wants no nonsense. "Go ahead," he
says, "play the game fair and never mind
who wins."</p>

<p>They take each other's hand, the whistle
blows and the fun is on. This is
genuine, dyed-in-the-wool sport, this is,
and all the boys are yelling their heads
off for their favorite.</p>

<p>"Go it, old Socks!" "Give it to him,
Chesty!" "Say, what did you let him
get away with that for?" These and
many more such exclamations are heard
on all sides.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>How easy it is for one to sit on the
fence and criticise the other fellow, to
tell him just what to do and how to do
it! But what a different proposition it
looks like when you try it yourself?</p>

<p>The first round is finished and the
boys are sitting back almost as tired as
the wrestlers. They are being taken
care of by the men appointed for that
task. As soon as they are rested, they
stand up, for all the world like a pair of
young bucks in the springtime, who are
eager to lock antlers and so long as they
conquer the other fellow, don't care how
much damage is done to them.</p>

<p>The second round is called; both boys
rush in, each eager to be at the other.
This is a most spirited and enjoyable
affair. It is first one then the other, until
one is dizzy watching them. Such
beautiful holds! such daring! such a
muscular exhibition, that the boys fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
go wild, and when this bout is declared
a draw, one cannot hear himself think
for the racket.</p>

<p>The third and last round is got over
in short time. One of the chaps, watching
his chance, puts the other down and
of course when his shoulders touch it is
all over.</p>

<p>Now for the boxing! We thought we
had tasted the cup of happiness to the
last drop when the wrestling was on, but
no, we had not. There was the sweetest
drop yet to be quaffed, and we quaffed
it alright, alright, that merry evening.</p>

<p>As usual, the very smallest boys were
picked out for the first bout; light
weight gloves strapped on, the mat removed,
the youngsters told what they
were not to do and then turned loose.</p>

<p>They put up a manly little exhibition
and at the end of the first round it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
only by a hairbreadth that it wasn't
called a draw.</p>

<p>In the second round they went at it a
little mite more furiously, and the prize
ring rules had to be read to them by the
Referee. They themselves did not
know whether they were fighting with
Queensbury rules or plain Johnson tactics.
Just having the time of their lives,
it was nip and tuck with them, all
around the ring; so much so, that when
the whistle blew the round was declared
a draw and the little chaps being slightly
winded, it was decided to let them off
the third round.</p>

<p>The next two to step up for the pleasure
of boxing were larger boys.</p>

<p>These were well matched in every respect,
both as to size, muscle and grit.
We knew they would make good. They
were both anxious to please their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
friends, and apart from that were chums.
Could two bosom friends come together
and try to get the best of each other?
That was the thought uppermost in
every one's mind. Well, they did, fought
like little men, a square, game fight,
each bound to win to show there was no
queer business; but there were only two
rounds fought. Then as each had won
one, the boxing bout was ended, to the
satisfaction of audience and performers.</p>

<p>But we have other ways of amusing
ourselves beside the two I have just
mentioned.</p>

<p>The boys who love chess will find
partners to play with, and can sit contented,
making one and a half moves
during the entire evening, if it so please
them to deliberate like that.</p>

<p>The checker fiends can play checkers
to their heart's content, jumping his men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and crowning a man king without half
the fuss the usual crowning of kings
calls for.</p>

<p>He just sticks one checker on the top
of another checker, when he has got to
the top row, looks his opponent in the
eye, and says "King," then begins to
waltz backward and forward up and
down, sweeping all the poor little men
he finds in his way into the discard. He
seems to forget the time when he was
only a little man himself. How like live
men that is! While some will be considerate
of those they have left behind
them in the race for fame and fortune,
others will step over them or push them
out of their way.</p>

<p>That old time game of dominoes must
not be forgotten. How many weary
hours it has beguiled away! New games
may come and new games will go, when
we are tired of them, but our pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
little oblong friends from blank blank to
double six will always find a welcome
here.</p>

<p>Then Lotto. Why, I am anything
but a spring chicken, yet Lotto was an
old game when I was young. What a
hurry and flurry to cover with bits of
glass the numbers as quickly as they
were called, and what a joyful yell when
you were out first!</p>

<p>On warm nights the boys sit out of
doors on the Campus. Some one starts
up a college song and the fun begins.
All the old time and all the new songs.
Among the voices a young tenor is
heard; he leads, all the rest joining in
the chorus.</p>

<p>Such a medley of sounds&mdash;the boy
who can sing and is willing, the boy who
can't sing and wants to; never mind,
when one is young everything goes; it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
only when one grows old that one becomes
hypercritical.</p>

<p>The night birds cease their songs, so
entranced are they at the human warbling.
The only feathered night prowler
who will not keep quiet is the owl, who
persists in joining in the chorus, his part
being a question, Who? Who? and then
flying quickly away.</p>

<p>These are all innocent little amusements
to while away the time until
"quarters" sound.</p>

<p>We have other pleasures of a different
nature, but those I will leave for another
chapter.</p>

<p>"Another evening gone!" you say.
"Why, I have done hardly anything at
all, and meant to do so much." It is
that way every evening. We plan to do
all sorts of things, but what with games,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
songs, feats of strength, spinning of
yarns, the time goes all too quickly.</p>

<p>The instructors walk about telling
their charges to get a move on. Everybody
goes to his tent to undress quickly,
plan for another day's fun and frolic;
then the bugler blows "Taps" and once
more we wrap our covers around us, lying
down to peaceful slumber. "So long,
Ned." "So long, Joe." "Good night,
fellows."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Camping Trips.</div>


<p>One would imagine that being at
Camp was enough for the average boy,
but it is not always so. After the first
novelty has worn off they want to go
around seeing other points of interest.
Therefore, the weekly Camping trips are
planned for them.</p>

<p>We take one day each week, plan
some place for each group of boys, who,
in charge of their instructor, go out
either for a tramping trip or by boat.</p>

<p>One group, for instance, plan to take
boats and provisions, row up stream for
several miles, make their camp on some
island, cook their meals, rest up, swim,
enjoy themselves by exploring the island,
returning in time for supper.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The next group plan a walking trip;
that is much harder on them than the
trip by water. They must carry their
own supplies, consisting of all kinds of
food, potatoes, bread, meat, eggs, coffee,
sugar, milk, matches, paper, fruit,
besides a cup for each boy, a frying pan,
coffee pot and pail for water.</p>

<p>Here you see the way boys act more
than on any other trip. The unselfish
chap will cheerfully fill his pockets with
raw potatoes, try and roll a can of tomatoes,
a pound of butter and half dozen
eggs altogether, in his rubber coat; put
the matches in his tin cup and stagger
away. What does it matter if the can
of tomatoes does object to being smeared
with the butter or the eggs protest at
the undue pressure that is put upon
them?</p>

<p>When some one yells at him that a
streak of yellow is running down his left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
leg he retorts with, "I don't care if it is.
Lots of fellows have streaks of yellow,
but they don't want to show it."</p>

<p>We clean him up, show him how to
pack hard substances together, and the
advantage of putting frail objects by
themselves; also that butter is apt to
melt if stored away inside one's blouse.
That crowd is started on its way quite
happy, although the lazy boy is grumbling
at having to carry the coffee-pot
and frying-pan, while the little chap is
leaving a trail of potatoes behind him.</p>

<p>Then there is the lazy lot who don't
care to walk, and don't want to row a
boat. What do they want?</p>

<p>They will take their share of grub and
go up to the ball field. Mind you, they
demand some of everything, particularly
the food that is easy of preparation.
The one and only idea that seems to percolate
through their brains is to get a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
whole lot of food; to make as little effort
as possible; to help themselves; to fuss
over everything; to be on the verge of
starting a half dozen times, only to come
back again with some new demand, just
like people who decide to take short
trips, they know not where, just to get
away.</p>

<p>For the rest of the day you may be
sure that whenever you look up towards
the baseball field you will see one or another
of that special party about to come
down to the house for more supplies, or
just to see what is going on.</p>

<p>How much happier they would have
been, had they gone with the crowd!
Nine times out of ten if you let a boy
have his way, he is not satisfied in the
end, and then is ready to put the blame
on the country, the lake, the faculty, the
dog, but not himself.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>There was another lot of boys who
were always under the impression that
the stay-at-homes were going to have so
much better time, so much better food,
something better than the rest of the
crowd, the sort of chaps that are a little
afraid of missing a trick.</p>

<p>Their special stunt was to ask the
doctor to look at their ears or throat,
complain of an all-gone feeling in the
pit of the stomach, a slightly dizzy feeling,
toothache or cramps.</p>

<p>When a boy really makes up his mind
to stay home there is no limit to his ingenuity
in thinking up some plausible
excuse. It would take a Philadelphia
lawyer to get the best of him.</p>

<p>The only way to take care of those
poor little, sick, helpless chaps is to have
the cook prepare the plainest kind of
fare for them. Leave them beautifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
alone and the day will drag along on
leaden wings. Long before the rest of
the boys return they will be heartily
tired of playing sick, and the next camping
trip that is planned will be among
the first lot of boys to want to go on a
long jaunt.</p>

<p>There is heaps of fun in cooking
your own dinner. What does it matter
if the chicken is scorched on the outside
while raw in the middle? The potatoes
with crisp skins but underdone in the
centre? Corn just warmed through?
Coffee hot if muddy? Paper plates?
Butter mixed with pepper? Salt mixed
with sugar? Water and milk blending
beautifully together? Bread and pie in
close embrace? Pickles and jam exchanging
flavors? As one good little
boy said: "What did it matter? Even
if you separated them ever so carefully,
they were bound to mix up in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
stomach; so if they were mixed up
beforehand it saved time and trouble
afterwards."</p>

<p>You couldn't serve such a meal as the
above indoors. It wouldn't taste right,
and it would not look right. It needs
the open air, with a background of green
forest; a gentle breeze blowing the
smoke in one's eyes as you watch the
fish frying; the cool water at your feet
inviting you to jump in, to cool your
fevered brow and wash some of the
smudge off yourself at the same time.
To say nothing of a crowd of hungry
boys who have left their manners and
fussy notions at home! Here they can
get along without a waiter standing at
the back of their chair, without an anxious
mother coaxing them to eat the
tenderloin, so long as they can see their
full share coming to them, they are
happy.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>I know lots of boys who at home are
waited upon hand and foot. Yet these
same congenial spirits can work like
Trojans when out for a day's sport, can
build dandy fireplaces with no better
material than sand wet with water and
bound with cobble stones.</p>

<p>The same boys can cook a meal fit for
a king. I don't mean the King of the
Cannibal Islands, but a real ruler, because
from what I have read the cannibals
are not so very particular. Anything
that comes their way, so long as
it will make a large, juicy meal, will do.
They don't care whether the meal is
composed of a real good, young missionary
or an old tough trader. They
would even take a party of elderly spinsters
and cook them for quite a while,
adding some extra seasoning.</p>

<p>But these boys I have in mind can
cook fish, chicken, potatoes and coffee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
in a way to make you thankful you are
living, both before and after the meal.</p>

<p>After the meal is over the question of
washing up comes before the board.
Most boys would prefer to throw the
whole business in the lake, but, having
pledged ourselves to see that they were
returned promptly to the kitchen, we
cannot allow that.</p>

<p>As usual, there are always one or two
who are more willing than the rest.
They start in to scrape the debris together,
put water on the fire to get hot,
and in many ways show that there was
lost to mankind a good girl when that
boy was created.</p>

<p>No matter where one travels, Nature
is charming in her virgin freshness.
Then look at the difference as soon as
human beings step in. The ground is
torn up, the flowers trampled underfoot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
trees chopped down, empty cans left lying
around, on every side upset, and untidiness!
Wouldn't it be nice if we just
tried to leave the woods and shore as
nearly like we found it, not an eyesore,
but a pleasure to go back to again?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Odds and Ends, Including Prayers.</div>


<p>When the days begin to grow hotter
and longer most people plan to leave the
City. Whether they go to the seashore
or to the mountains, to the lake district
or some quiet village, they carefully (or
so it seems to me) put away their religion
along with their winter clothes.</p>

<p>You will find people who are regular
attendants at their respective churches
all winter long staying away from
church, Sunday after Sunday, throughout
the summer.</p>

<p>It makes not the slightest difference
whether Jew or Gentile, Catholic or Scientist,
they all stay away more or less
during the summer, and even at Camp,
when the call to prayers is sounded,
they come in a half-hearted way.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Can one really get along for months
without religion? Have they soaked
up, absorbed, into their systems enough
during the cold weather to tide them
over the warm? Can the average
church-goer, no matter what church he
goes to, store away in his heart and
brain enough religion to last, or must
he keep on returning to the Fountainhead
to be renewed and refreshed?</p>

<p>As I said, the boys straggled in to listen
to a true man of God, but some of
them came because they had promised
to do so, a few just because they really
wanted to be there, and the rest because
it is human nature to follow a leader.</p>

<p>What excuses we always have ready
on hand to show why we have not gone
to the House of God! It is too hot, it
is too cold, it is dusty, it is wet, no
clothes fit to wear, the Sunday dinner
to cook, too lazy to get up, all these and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
a lot more, just because the House of
God stands with doors wide open!</p>

<p>You can walk in without the trouble
of going to the ticket office for a reserved
seat. You don't have to stand in line,
glad to buy a standing-room-only ticket.
If you desire music, it is there in its
purest form for you to listen to. Do
you care for singing? Then there you
can hear anthems, hymns and oratorios
as they never are sung anywhere else.</p>

<p>It needs the sacred silence of the
House of God, the subdued coloring, the
general air of peace and holiness to
bring these things fully to your heart,
yet you have to be coaxed to go there.</p>

<p>The House of God has always seemed
to me like the house of a very dear
friend. Of course, being so far away,
we don't think we must pay our respects
in person to the Lord. If we have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
dear friend (even though full of faults)
we keep in touch with him, call upon
him, let him know in many ways that
we are his very dear friend. Then why
not go to the House of God for the same
purpose, with the same kind feeling in
our heart?</p>

<p>Then the boys sat in silence while the
man of God prayed for them, for the
good of their souls, that they might
grow up doing at all times, whether in
company or alone, the right thing in the
sight of the Lord, blessed them, sent
them on their way, with purer thoughts
to help them out of the many pitfalls
that beset the feet of youth.</p>

<p>After services are ended we allow the
boys to play games. Of what use
would it be to compel them to sit quiet
all day reading books that they did not
care for? Besides, a forced religion
isn't worth powder to blow it up.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us hope that when fall comes and
they take their religion (they have so
gently packed away in camphor) out it
will not show any signs of decay, no
moths or other evidences of dissolution,
but a bright, loving light to lead their
footsteps to His Throne.</p>

<p>Sunday at Camp is much like any
other day, excepting that the laundry is
given out and the outgoing wash collected.</p>

<p>The boys form into line under the direction
of the faculty, are sent down in
companies of ten according to their
numbers, to the laundry room, where
they receive the clean wash, consisting
of personal clothes, besides sheets, towels
and pillow slips, take them up to
their tents, put them in their trunks, excepting
what they put into immediate
use.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>After breakfast they gather up all the
soiled wash, make out a duplicate list,
and have them ready when the man calls
at each tent for them. Quite a clever
system that works out all right.</p>

<p>Sunday afternoon is spent on the
water or some game is started up. The
usual swimming is indulged in, and by
supper time everybody is ready to peck
a bit of food, even if they have dined
later and had a most bountiful repast.</p>

<p>In the evening the fun begins. Generally
on Sunday the Literary Society
has an open meeting. Everything goes,
from a banjo solo to an imitation fight
between two noted prize-fighters.</p>

<p>The little boys recite, the big ones
give monologues, our celebrated orchestra
renders stirring selections, and the
entire Camp joins in the chorus.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>The instructors cheerfully help out.
It matters not what you ask them to do!
Sing a solo? Why, yes; he will be delighted.
Sing a duet? Pleased to oblige
such an appreciative audience. Join in
a quartette? Why, nothing would give
him greater happiness.</p>

<p>It makes no difference how silly they
have to act. They just go ahead. Anything
to please the boys and keep them
in good spirits.</p>

<p>Were Hammerstein ever to come out
to Camp on a Sunday evening he would
find more real talent on our little stage
than he has at his own vaudeville house.</p>

<p>The evening ends very happily, all
voting it a bully good show. They give
three cheers for the performers, and with
a final cheer for good measure, "Quarters"
are sounded.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a happy crowd that slowly wends
its way to the tents, and many a laugh
is heard as they go over the evening's
performance.</p>

<p>The faculty clear the place, leaving
everything in apple-pie order for the
morrow. "Taps" are sounded by the
bugler and another happy day is done.</p>

<p>As we grow older it may take more to
please us, but I feel confident that some
of these days will be remembered long
after we have grown up. Life would,
indeed, be for many of us a very sad
thing if we had not childhood's happy
days to look back on.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a><br /><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Football.</div>


<p>Why there should be such excitement
about a game of football I have never
been able to find out. When all is said
and done you can hardly see the players.
They are bunched together most of the
time. They stand bent over, looking
for all the world as though they were
about to play leapfrog.</p>

<p>Then some under-sized little shrimp
of a fellow begins to yell 4-11-44, 7-28-7-11,
and all manner of numbers; he
grows fearfully excited over the stupidity
of his team; they evidently don't understand
the signals.</p>

<p>In a perfect frenzy of passion and despair
he raises his voice and almost
weeps. Sometimes he says things that
are not in the polite letter writer; not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the things that a gentle youth would
send in a letter to his best girl, but the
rest of the team don't seem to mind it at
all. The other side is doing the same.
They have also a man whose special mission
in life seems to be howling with all
his might while madly springing up and
down.</p>

<p>Again they form and await the whistle
of the umpire. Every man acts as
though the eyes of the entire sporting
world were upon him.</p>

<p>Gee! If they can only get the start;
what they won't do to the other side!
The whistle blows, one yard gained after
a terrific struggle; form again, more
numbers yelled in a voice hoarse from
much shouting, then they are off again!
A splendid kick causing the ball to form
a perfect curve as it sails through the
air, one great big chap fairly springs up
several feet to catch it as it comes down;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
he runs, and his side, when the whistle
blows, have gained five yards. I stand
idly watching them, wishing that the
game was more familiar to me. It must
be a good game, after all is said and
done, or people would not go wild about
it.</p>

<p>The first half is over. Now the umpire
is quite a busy man. Let us trust
he has taken out a traveling life insurance
policy, for he certainly needs it as
he wanders up and down. Each side is
filing its protests. If he is to believe
them they have each been guilty of everything
but piracy on the high seas.</p>

<p>Several boys have been knocked out
for a minute. They are being attended
to by the surgeon and staff&mdash;a liberal
sprinkling of water besides massage sets
them up again quite eager to join the
fray.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>The coach calls his crowd around him,
scolds some, praises others, warns all to
go carefully. The little chap, whose special
mission in life seems to be to cuss
and yell numbers as fast as he can get
them out, is on hand; watches his opportunity
to remind them that when he
says 8-7-6-5-4 he does not mean 93-2-15;
begs them, for sweet love's sake, to go
in and win.</p>

<p>The referee blows the whistle. Both
sides form. They toss up for the first
choice, and off they go.</p>

<p>In spite of one's desire to sit quietly
and let them chew each other up like a
pack of Kilkenny cats, until nothing but
the tails are left, you find yourself yelling,
jumping, running along with the
rest of the crowd.</p>

<p>"A goal! a goal!" they shriek, and all
because one boy has thrown the ball
over. Phew! what excitement! what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
joy for the winners! sympathy for the
losers! a happy blending of praise and
blame!</p>

<p>No matter where you go it is just as
bad; that is, in any English-speaking
country.</p>

<p>This fall I saw, while in Lincoln, England,
a tremendous crowd coming out
of the railroad station. They were pushing
and jostling each other. Some were
packed six deep in cabs, riding in butchers'
carts, on bicycles, on tricycles. I
had almost said icicles, because they
were going any way so long as they got
there. My curiosity at last got the best
of me, and I stopped a good-natured
looking man. "My friend," I said,
"what are you all in such a hurry for?
Is there a hanging going on, or has England
declared herself a Republic?"</p>

<p>He looked at me with a pitiful smile,
as though to pity my ignorance.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Madam," he said, "it is a game
of football, and they kick off at 2.30,"
and off he ran.</p>

<p>On this particular day the Reds won,
to the everlasting sorrow of the Blues.</p>

<p>Boys are nice chaps, anyhow. Just
as soon as the game is over there is not
one bit of hard feeling between victor
and vanquished. They shake hands, say
better luck next time and are ready for
the next game.</p>

<p>If we could carry that spirit with us
out into the world, what a lot of good
it would do us, as well as the other poor
soul who has lost in the game of life. At
least let us try and give the other chap
a fair show, a run for his money, so to
say. Then if we do come out ahead it
won't matter so much. A kind word,
a loving thought, means a lot to the
chap who has lost, while to us it affords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
some satisfaction to have won modestly,
not to fly on the top of the fence, flap
our wings and crow like the victorious
cock.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Boating.</div>


<p>Boating has always been a much-sought-after
pastime. The boat, even
as little children, we were very fond of
was one called Noah's Ark. Ours was
filled with cute little animals, and trees,
and houses, that gave us great pleasure
to arrange, always taking care to make
them walk two by two, each couple of
bears or elephants or cats, or any other
animal, never on any account to put a
rat with a cat or a tiger with a goat, as
we were taught that they had to pair off
the right way.</p>

<p>Noah's ark was a good old boat. From
what I can make out it must have been
somewhat like a present-day houseboat,
while the lower half was like a cattle
carrier.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Jolly time Friend Noah must have
had to preserve order. Of course, the
fear of being thrown overboard probably
kept them behaving fairly well.
Still it must have been a dreary time for
all, not like the boating at Camp.</p>

<p>The Vikings with their war vessels
manned by dozens of slaves, some of
them below decks where they had to sit
chained together, plying the long sweeps
for dear life&mdash;death for them if they
failed&mdash;death for them at the end always.
Poor, poor fellows! I never
read about them but my heart aches.</p>

<p>What thousands of human beings
have been sacrificed to bring our civilization
up to its present humane standard!
That was another kind of boating
for you.</p>

<p>We can go on and on, down to the
present time, and find in every period
something to interest, to shock, to awaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
our truest sympathy for those who
have gone before, but as this is not a
history of boats and boatmen, just an
account of our outings, I will not digress
any longer.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the season we
don't care what kind of a boat we go out
in so long as it is a boat, but in a few
days we begin to notice the great difference
between a flat-bottomed boat
and a dory, between a canoe-shaped boat
and one with bow and stern. The advantages
of each and every one are
quickly mastered, until at the end of the
first week we have pinned our faith to
one particular kind, to the exclusion of
all others. Then our usual selfishness
begins to show. We charter that boat,
and woe be to the fellow who takes it.</p>

<p>A boat that you are used to is like a
friend. You seem to get right in mood
with it, can tell to a second when to humor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
it, and in return the boat answers to
every move you make. If you like a
boat and have been out in it, no matter
whether the wind comes up suddenly or
a storm threatens, you feel perfectly
safe. You can take one oar, stand up at
one end and make her go like an obedient
steed, ride the waves, turn any way
you wish, fool around as long as you
like, then make a home run up to the
dock with flying colors.</p>

<p>You can do that with a canoe-shaped
boat, because, if you are turned around
by the current, all you have to do is to
turn yourself, and either end of the boat
is the stern, as you wish. But so much
for a rowboat.</p>

<p>Have you ever tried going out in one
of those dinky little sailboats? That is
Simon-pure sport for you. When the
boat is loaded with her living freight she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
is probably about six inches above the
water line. Any little sudden gust
causes her to keel 'way over. Between
the jolly captain trying to get the benefit
of every puff of wind and the nervous
passengers you have the time of your
life. All other boating fades away compared
to being in a sailboat with just
enough breeze to send her along while
causing her to keel over at the slightest
move. You lie on your stomach on the
bottom, letting any bilge water slopping
around loose soak into your chest. Of
course, you have a swimming suit on.
That is advisable, in case you went overboard
or the boat turned turtle, a custom
our little boat showed a tendency
to do on the slightest provocation.</p>

<p>She wasn't the kind of boat that you
would have wanted to take a nervous
mother out in or any one, in fact, that
was not well able to swim; but with congenial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
companions, who could take care
of themselves, there was more fun to be
got out of that little boat than any in
Camp.</p>

<p>Then there were the motor boats; just
made for the rapid consumption of oil.
Their motto was: "Maximum of oil with
minimum of speed," made out of deference
to the Standard Oil Company. No
man not extremely wealthy could afford
to own one of them. Between drinking
oil by the gallon and quarrelling with
their igniter they were in dry dock for
repairs most of the season.</p>

<p>The real pets of the Camp were the
four-oared barges. You felt yourself
some boatman when you went out in
one of them. With a nifty coxswain in
the stern to keep time for you, plenty of
room to make your stroke, one of the
best fellows as stroke oar, there was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
a pleasanter sensation going than to go
for a good, long row.</p>

<p>Sometimes you caught a crab, that
caused some little delay, while you were
spoken to in a real fatherly way by the
coxswain. Then again you persisted
in making your time to suit yourself
without any regard to orders. On one
side the oars pulled a much stronger
stroke than the other side, constantly
skewing the boat, in spite of the best
efforts of our tiller ropes. About the
only time you showed any kind of form
was on the homestretch. Then, playing
to the gallery, you put your best
efforts into every move of your body,
going by the Camp to the landing stage
in a manner to make even the Oxford
and Cambridge crews look up and take
notice.</p>

<p>All that was only practice. The real
thing that counted was when the races<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
were planned. Then the boys began to
work, to get up early in the morning for
special coaching trips, to train in every
way, to leave off all sweets; and when
a boy does that, you may know he is in
dead earnest, until as the day drew
near all they could talk, think, eat and
sleep was boat talk.</p>

<p>It is a bad thing to wager on a boat
race. Yet what a fascination there is in
boosting your own side up. You feel
sure they will win. Haven't you with
heart, soul and mind urged them on for
weeks? How can they lose?</p>

<p>You get out and cheer them along,
ready to fight with tongue or fists for
the glory of your colors. You know it
is against Camp rules to wager; yet in
the excitement of the moment you promise
to forgive debts if you lose and in
every way show your faith in your side.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>They are ready to start. With many
a cheery word for them you wish them
Godspeed, at the same time feeling a perfect
hatred, for the time being, for your
opponents. Gee! if you could only go
along with them to cheer them on the
course!</p>

<p>They have started, rowing easily to
the starting point. Oh! will they never
get there? And yet you have warned
them about taking it easy to the starting
mark. At last they are there, are
turning round; the pistol is fired and
they are off. "Come on, come on!" you
yell, long before they can hear you. They
seem to be working with might and
main, but what is that? The other team
seems to be getting ahead. No; it cannot
be. It should not be. In your wild
excitement you fall off the rock you are
standing on, pulling into the water a
couple of onlookers with you. What
does a wetting amount to, anyway?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>You dare not look when you get back
on the rock again, yet, like some horrible
monster that fascinates you, you
turn around, to see your beloved Blues a
boat's length behind. If praying would
help them, they can know that you
prayed; if weeping for them would have
been of any use to save the day, you had
done that, too; what was left but the
deepest despair.</p>

<p>The Reds won, and my whole nature
felt steeped in the deepest blue.</p>

<p>The villain came up to me to claim his
wager, with a grin all over his face, making
you think of a huge Cheshire cat.</p>

<p>So ended the boat race I had set my
heart upon.</p>

<div class='poem'>"But what is the use of repining,<br />

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Final Contests&mdash;Track Work.</div>


<p>After training for weeks one begins
to look for some satisfactory results. It
is about this time that the boys who
have made a special study of track work,
under the guidance of a clever instructor,
can begin to feel enough confidence
in his work to warrant his entering for
the final contests.</p>

<p>Oftentimes the boy with the shortest
legs has the keenest desire to enter for
the standing broad jump. Is it his fault
if his legs have not kept pace with his
will and brain? You really feel the truest
sympathy for him because he always
falls an inch or two short. Again he
tries, but no go. How can he help it?
His spirit is willing, but his legs too
short.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The big boy with legs so long that he
looks like an animated compass as he
strides along is the next to try.</p>

<p>Now you have pinned your faith to
him. If he, with those legs, cannot go
in and wrest the honors, then who can?
He makes a brave enough start, but
jumps so wildly that he falls, scattering
the dirt all over without gaining enough
inches to speak of.</p>

<p>Next to step forward is a spare-built
medium sized boy, about the frying size,
with not one ounce of flesh to spare, fine
bones, slim little ankles, broad chest,
good eye for measurement and plenty of
strength to carry him over. His followers
have great belief in him and frankly
tell him they depend upon his work to
gain their side so many extra points.</p>

<p>Sometimes if we endow a man with all
kinds of virtues, he will really try and
live up to them, if only to show us that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
he can make good. Again he will make
good because he wants to do so, both for
his own sake and ours. This boy was
of that type, loved to do the best in his
power to oblige his friends and also because
it pleased himself.</p>

<p>He made good, as we all knew he
would, winning for his side far more
points than they deserved.</p>

<p>The excitement grew so that it was
necessary to appoint deputy sheriffs to
keep the peace.</p>

<p>All morning were the running, jumping,
hurdle races, short sprints, long
sprints, broad jumps, standing high, hop
skip and jump, every jump known to
mankind and a lot that are not known.</p>

<p>The only jump that I did not see done
was the one we all are very familiar with,
viz., "Jumping to a conclusion," and
the reason that was not practised was
that there was no prize offered for it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>The next event on the schedule was
junior running races. All of the little
fellows who had ambition enough, combined
with wind and muscle, were entered.
It is one thing to think you can
run a race, but quite another thing to
keep on going after the first excitement
is over.</p>

<p>All you can think of as you run, run,
run, is the beating of your heart, your
breath growing shorter, a sharp pain
running through the calves of your legs,
a nasty stitch in your side, and then the
worst and hardest sound of all, the
breathing of the fellow behind you. You
feel without looking back that he is gaining
on you at every yard.</p>

<p>"If you can only keep going," is your
unspoken prayer, until you are around
the next turn. "Go it, old boy," you
hear them yell. You don't know whether
it is intended for you or for the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
behind you. Anyway it spurs you on.
Why shouldn't you take that yell for
encouragement for you? As you turn
into the home stretch, the boys who are
friendly to you run alongside on the
infield cheering and pacing you right up
to the wire. Oh! thank goodness, you
have broken right through the line, to
fall, happy though exhausted, into the
arms of your friends.</p>

<p>One race after another is run off
during the morning. It matters not
whether it is a junior, intermediate or
senior race; the same rules and regulations
hold good, fair play, no crowding
and handicaps where needed. Then at
the signal every man to do the best he
can, win if possible, never quit unless
taken ill, run the race through, even
though it is a losing one for you.</p>

<p>In every race there can only be one
winner, several who are placed, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
rest are grouped under one head and
called "also rans."</p>

<p>Whether it is horses or men the same
spirit prevails. The horse with grit will
go ahead. Sometimes his shoes don't
fit. His bridle is not properly adjusted,
hurting his poor mouth fearfully and
causing it to bleed. His harness is loose
where it ought to be tight. Tight where
it ought to be loose. The driver is far
more of a brute than the beast he is
driving, and yet you will see, in spite of
all these drawbacks, that horse, with so
much grit, such a game sport, that he
will come in winning by a nose, though
afterwards one can see him being led to
his stable with drooping head and limping
feet.</p>

<p>The same with a boy. If he has the
pluck, grit, gameness, call it what you
like, he will go ahead in spite of all obstacles;
win if possible, come second if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
that is the best he can do, and if he lose,
why, then he will look the world in the
face knowing he has done his level best.</p>


<h3>Separate Games.</h3>

<p>Throwing the discus is another manly
sport that calls for splendid muscular
action, accurate balancing, steady
nerves, good eyes and quick action.</p>

<p>This game, old as the hills, is still very
popular. Its followers try to play it in
both a scientific and artistic manner,
taking poses that remind us of Greek
gods. There is keen competition between
the contestants, and prizes are
awarded the winners.</p>


<h3>Putting the Shot.</h3>

<p>This game might have been handed
down from the time of David, who so
cleverly put his shot that Goliath was
killed, to the surprise and joy of his enemies.
Like throwing the discus, it calls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
for strength, speed and courage. It is
a particularly good exercise for the arm
and shoulder muscles, but being rather
strenuous, is a game for the older boys,
who enjoy it very much. Like all other
games at Camp, prizes are awarded for
the best record.</p>


<h3>Quoits.</h3>

<p>Still another of the good old games
that is as popular on sea as on land. The
only difference is that the rings are
made of rope for sea use while of iron
for those on shore.</p>

<p>On board ship it looks quite easy to
throw the ring over the stick, but what
with the motion of the vessel and poor
calculation, it more often rolls to one
side than makes a ringer.</p>

<p>On shore it is not so easy, either. The
ground, from being pounded so often by
the iron quoits, becomes powdery, the
stake is harder to find as the player finds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
out. One ringer, out of a dozen throws,
would be called very fine playing.</p>

<p>It is lots of sport; good to train the
eye for measuring distances, the arms
to curb their strength, just as the least
little bit too much muscle sends the
quoits 'way off, and last, teaches one to
have infinite patience.</p>


<h3>Shuffle Board.</h3>

<p>Like quoits, we play this game at
Camp as well as at sea. Compare our
dandy big table at Camp with firm floor
to stand on with the deck of a ship. You
cannot begin to make the scores at sea
that you can on land. With the best of
intentions you send your board along,
thinking it will send your opponents off
while giving you an added score. Does
it do that for you? Well, not always.
Most of the time yours goes off or stays
on the wrong square, deducting your
score while adding to theirs.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>On our table at Camp the chances are
better for both sides. We play many a
spirited game for fun during the season.
When the final contests take place this
indoor game, as well as any other one,
has its turn. Sides are chosen, the losers
dropping out while the winners play
each other. When the contestants get
down to two men the final game is
played. As usual, the winner receives
a prize.</p>

<p>For the smaller fry the games of
checkers, dominoes, etc., etc., offer a
chance to even the littlest Camper to
compete and win a prize.</p>

<p>Most of the boys would engage in
these pastimes for fun, even if there was
not any reward offered, but the promise
of some prize always stirs up the indolent
and timid boy.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a><br /><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Visitors.</div>


<p>After the boys are settled at Camp
for a few weeks they begin to look forward
to a visit from some of their folks.
They plan what they are going to do
and what points of interest they will
take them to, and hope with all their
heart, soul and mind that a large box of
good things may be sent up for the tent.</p>

<p>What does it matter if they are forbidden
to receive such articles? Either
by begging, pleading or some other excuse
they let the Director know that this
is their first offence. They will only eat
a little at a time, and divide it with a lot
of boys, thus lessening the danger of
overeating, and getting the credit of being
generous at one and the same time.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Some parents take long trips themselves
while their children are with us.
Other parents plan to come as a surprise.</p>

<p>When they drive or auto in the first
feeling that most mothers have is amazement
at the undressed condition of their
offspring. As quickly as they can get
out of carriage or automobile they hasten
to button up the shirt, if the boy has
one on, or to plead with him to put one
on if his is off. They feel the breezes
blow and shiver at the thought of the
boys sleeping in such open tents; advise
that the tent flaps be tightly closed at
night for fear of the boys taking cold.</p>

<p>They seem to think we are a hardened,
cruel crowd because we laugh at
their fears. It is not one bit of use trying
to convince mother because she
won't be convinced. So we save our
breath for father. Here we have some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
ground upon which to sow our seed.
We invite him to stay a day or two;
"Peel off," we tell him, and "be a boy
again. Go in swimming. Go out in a
boat. Try a game of ball. Play a set
of tennis. Do a little sprint around the
running track. We can offer you a lot
more sports if you will stay and visit
us," we tell him.</p>

<p>In the evenings we can play shuffle
board, have some good music, some
singing that will make the cats on the
back fence green with envy; then last,
but not least, we can have a camp-fire.
Have you ever been out in the country
and helped build a real camp-fire?</p>

<p>After supper every one is pressed into
service to help gather the wood. Little
chaps stagger along under heavier loads
than they can carry, dropping two
pieces for every one they pick up, but
never saying die. I just love those little
gritty kids.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>The bigger boys and instructors carry
regular old trees, reminding one of an
army of ants struggling along manfully
to move their quarters.</p>

<p>One or two capable men, who have
the art of building bonfires down to a
fine point, stay on the field to receive
the wood, pile it up and start the fire
going.</p>

<p>That is the preliminary only. Are we
going to have a corn roast? Then the
juicy ears of corn, two for every boy,
are brought up to the field. Plenty of
good butter and salt in a large bowl is
at hand. The boys, visitors and all,
form in line, march past the table, where
the supplies are heaped up, receive their
portion, and hurry along.</p>

<p>By this time the fire has died down to
a bright red glow. The smoke and
blazes have stopped, the embers being
just right to cook the corn; it is stripped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of its silk, then the leaves are carefully
put back in place and laid down where
it will cook through without burning.</p>

<p>Song, laughter and sport pass the
time until a fragrant smell assures us
that something is doing. Gee whiz!
Strip the leaves off. Butter it generously.
Never mind if the butter does
run down your arm. Close your eyes
and sink your teeth into it.</p>

<p>In polite homes they have corn holders,
and dainty little knives for splitting
it open so that the butter can soak in, and
all manner of helps to make corn eating
a dainty pleasure. They can have them
in their homes all they like, but out here,
under this beautiful sky, dotted with
stars like tiny lanterns to show us what
to do, give me my ear of sweet corn and
let me eat it this way.</p>

<p>Sometimes we have a marshmallow
roast, generally a treat from one of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
kind visitors, who may not have even
stayed to enjoy it with us.</p>

<p>After our fire is just right we serve
out the marshmallows to the boys. This
time they have a very sharp-pointed
stick, on which they gently fasten one
at a time, holding them close enough to
the fire to roast them. They say they
are delicious, and, judging from the fact
that frequently they eat between them
all, about 2,000 marshmallows, they
must be very palatable. Personally, I
cannot vouch for them, as, somehow or
other, I don't like them, either cooked
or raw, though my friends persist in
treating me to them.</p>

<p>Another treat is a clambake and watermelon
feast. That we have on the shore.
When packed in sea weed, all manner of
good things are roasted, including the
faces and hands of the good-natured
helpers.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Sweet potatoes roasted this way are
delicious, and chicken has an entirely
different taste than that cooked in the
oven. There is something for every
kind of taste and appetite, and plenty to
go around.</p>

<p>The modest boy is helped to his share,
the independent chap is allowed to help
himself, while the greedy fellow is held
back for fear he will overload and capsize.
At last even the boy who is hard to
please declares he has had enough. So
with a rousing cheer for the kind visitor
whose guests we have been, the bugler
sounds "Quarters," a welcome sound to
us all. Sometimes the visitor asks if he
can become a Camper for a few days or
a week. He will gladly pay for the
great privilege, for such it is, to be a boy
again among boys.</p>

<p>It is granted to him; not one extra
for him, mind you. He must take what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the Campers have, the same fare, the
same tents, the same beds. If he wishes
to join us on these conditions, well and
good. Then he can come in and welcome.</p>

<p>From a responsible man of business in
the city, in one short night he turns
Time back in his flight and becomes
again a merry, happy boy, a boy with a
capacity for enjoying the simple pleasures
of Camp life more than any growing
boy can understand.</p>

<p>Hasn't he seen both sides of the picture?
Doesn't he know that the plain,
clean way of living we have out there is
the only true way to exist? What kind
of food can give him the satisfaction
that this rough fare does? When, with
appetite sharpened by sleeping in the
open air, enough physical exercise to
make his blood flow with renewed purity
through his system, he sits at table, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
not idly wonders whether there will be
anything worth eating, but only hopes
there will be two helpings of everything.
Like poor, little Oliver Twist, he asks
for more.</p>

<p>Such a Visitor will turn to and help
the little chaps, will go down to the
beach with them, show them how to
wash and take care of their clothes, go
in the water with them, and take them
out in the boats. He acts for all the
world like a big, good-hearted brother.</p>

<p>In return there isn't a Camper, from
the Director down to the dog, that
doesn't adore him, and will at every and
any time do anything in his power to
make his stay enjoyable.</p>

<p>Our keenest regret is when the day
comes for him to leave us. Not alone
does he carry back to the city renewed
health, strength and spirits, but the happiness
of knowing that while he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
taking a vacation for himself he was
endearing himself to every one at Camp.</p>

<p>Of course, every visitor is not an angel
in disguise. We could not expect
that. Some come; keep to themselves,
and depart, without having caused one
ripple on our surface. Yet we are glad
to see them, to do all we can for their
comfort, and then to wish them Godspeed
at their going.</p>

<p>A few come who are ripe with suggestions
for the better way to run our affairs.
If it makes them happier to suggest,
let them go ahead. It won't hurt
us any. When one is sure they are doing
the right thing it matters little what
other people think. We keep on doing
the right.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a><br /><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Last Days.</div>


<p>To some of the boys last days at
Camp bring sadness. They are the ones
who, having neither brother nor sister,
begin to realize how lonely it will be at
home compared to the bustle out here.
They love their parents, are anxious to
see them, glad to get back to their orderly
bedroom and to the daintily set
table. All that kind of thing is good to
look forward to, yet how lonesome it
will be. Of course, they will meet at
school and at each other's homes, but
not be together all day and night like
this.</p>

<p>They plan to be at each other's houses
as often as possible; to never, never forget
each other, and be sure to share the
same tent next season.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>All the season long the untidy boy has
opened his trunk, reached around any
old way for anything he might need
at that particular moment, found it,
slammed the lid down without regard to
hinges or lock. Day after day he has
done this, never once looking at his list
so carefully pasted on the inside of the
cover.</p>

<p>Anyway, what would be the use of
looking at the list; it will be time when
he packs up to go home. Day after day
you pick up quantities of clothing belonging
to boys who have thrown them
around, remind them that they will be
short when they compare their list and
stock on hand. They don't care, and
very often are saucy. So the time
passes away until a couple of days before
Camp breaks up.</p>

<p>Now is the time for vain regrets.
Where is that bathing towel that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
left lying around loose for weeks? What
has become of those swimming trunks?
Who has seen the mates of both these
sneakers? These and fifty more questions
are asked of every one in sight.</p>

<p>Sometimes you find some of your belongings
under the tent, some in the
bath-house, one or two in the dark room
used to keep out the light. Several articles
without labels you claim as your
own, anything, everything, to help fill
that trunk.</p>

<p>Some articles cannot be put in, owing
to wear and tear, especially tear. They
have gone into the discard long ago.
Then, again, some have been borrowed
and never returned. The average Camper
does not think that "he who goes a-borrowing
'goes a-sorrowing," and
cheerfully asks for what he wants, letting
the lender do the sorrowing at the
end of the season.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>The careful boy can pack his trunk,
find almost all his clothes and bats, balls,
Kodaks, etc., etc., can even close his
trunk without the aid of the locksmith.
There are more tidy than untidy boys,
for which may we be truly thankful.</p>

<p>Along about the time everybody is
packing up the boys, who have brought
along or bought while in Camp a felt
hat, want to have all their friends write
their names on it. Some of them are
works of art, and one feels quite proud
to put his name on, to be in company
with so many celebrated signatures.</p>

<p>Often have I wondered what they do
with them when they get home. Suppose
they hang them up on the walls of
their bedrooms as trophies.</p>

<p>After you have written on his hat, very
often you write in some book for him.
About half the Camp is writing on each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
other's hats, pants or books. Everywhere
you go you will see boys armed
with pens, making you think of the old
saying about the pen being mightier
than the sword.</p>

<p>A general resting up for everybody is
advocated after the final contests. That
gives one a chance to relax and rest up
before going home.</p>

<p>Lessons are stopped; the hour being
devoted to siesta instead.</p>

<p>Boys who have all the season neglected
their letter-writing tasks begin to get
very busy. You will be besieged by requests
for paper, envelopes and stamps.
They intend letting the family know
they are coming.</p>

<p>The boy who during the entire season
has sent a blank piece of paper in his envelope,
by that means assuring them
that no news is good news, now undertakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
to write a real letter to apprise
them of his return. This so frightens
the family that they send a despatch
asking if all's well.</p>

<p>The little boys are all very anxious to
be met at the depot, also to remind the
folks to have a good breakfast ready.</p>

<p>Home-coming always seems sweeter
if there is some one to meet us, but we
cannot all have loving fathers, devoted
mothers, affectionate aunts, sisters or
cousins. So the boy who has no one to
meet him is not left all alone, but is personally
seen to his home or train, as the
case may be.</p>

<p>Music and song, games and jollity
pass the time every evening until a few
nights before the end. Then our celebrated
artists give a show.</p>

<p>Whatever we should do without some
of our friends I cannot say. What cheerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
spirits they bring to bear! How
willing they are to do any and every
thing, from painting the scenery to
painting their own faces!</p>

<p>We can call upon them at any time
for help, tell them "You must be a villain,
a hero, a lover, a drummer." No
matter what we ask for, some of them
are ready and willing.</p>

<p>The show cannot fail, the critics who
sit in front, and who are more to be
dreaded than Alan Dale or Acton Davis,
only spur us on to do the best that is in
us. We have rehearsed over and over
again until those who haven't clean forgot
every word are letter perfect.</p>

<p>Sometimes the villain will make a better
hero. All right, we give him that
role. Again the heroine would look better
as the father. That is easily managed.
Change clothes and you change
sex at the same time.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing daunts us. We would not
enjoy the show half so much if all were
smooth sailing.</p>

<p>The night arrives at last to give it;
you really would not think these were
all city boys, who were used to everything
from grand opera to vaudeville.
So eager are they to help, to advise, to
get the best seats, that tremendous excitement
prevails all over Camp.</p>

<p>It is rather hard to dress a group of
actors and actresses when your principal
stock in trade consists of two rolls of
crepe paper, some puffs of artificial hair
and a few ribbons. Makes one think of
"a rag and a bone and a hank of hair."</p>

<p>We have the rags and the hank of
hair, and the boys furnish the bones.
We manage with the aid of tinfoil, crepe
paper and odds and ends of our personal
wardrobe to make quite a decent
showing.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>The show goes off without any hitch.
Everybody is good-natured; the critics
assure us it was very good, and we clean
up the mess, very happy to have been of
service once more.</p>

<p>With a vote of thanks to all the willing
workers who helped us, the boys
once more are glad to obey the bugler
when he sounds "Quarters."</p>

<p>They undress quickly, not at all minding
going to bed with faces covered with
grease, paint or charcoal. Youth does
not bother about its complexion. By
morning most of it is on the pillow slip,
and soap and water will clean up the
rest.</p>

<p>The theatrical effects are all carefully
packed away, to do duty for another season.
The lamps are put out, the curtain
rolled up, scenery stored and finis written
on the season's offerings.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Lots of work. Lots of worry. Little
to do with. Plenty of people to please,
and yet! What pleasure in pleasing
others! How happy if only they were
satisfied! Could I have my choice, in
all sincerity, give me the chance to
please the children and I could die
happy.</p>

<p>The bugler is blowing "Taps." The
lights are going out. Once more a
sweet good-night to you.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Awarding Prizes.</div>


<p>Every season it is just the same. As
the last night draws near there is great
excitement among all the boys. Those
who have earned medals, cups or prizes
try to appear unconcerned, while the rest
of the Campers handle, fondle and criticise
the gifts.</p>

<p>We ourselves, who expect none, and
wouldn't know what to do with a medal
if one was given to us, are just as eager
and joyful as the smallest Camper there.</p>

<p>When all is ready, what a hush! You
can actually hear yourself think as the
Director stands up. He looks around
with happy smile at the roomful of waiting
boys. Begins to read from a list in
his hand the name of some one fortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
fellow, who steps forward to receive his
medal or cup, as the case may be. Everybody
must see it, read the inscription,
look at the engraving, look at the case
to hold it, before returning it to the winner
and owner.</p>

<p>It is the same with each and every
boy, whether the medal is of gold, silver
or bronze, whether he received it for
swimming or rowing, for running or
jumping, for feats of strength, like putting
the shot or throwing the discus.
What matter if it was for football or
baseball, tennis or diving? It is a medal,
given for merit, and as such appreciated
by both winner and friends.</p>

<p>The most popular boy is awarded.
The best all-around Camper is medalled.
There is hardly an act of courage
or endurance that is passed by without
some recognition. Such an uproar as
greets each new hero!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>While we enjoy it with them ever so
much, yet we are glad when at last they
are all awarded, leaving us the pleasure
of hearing the different members of the
faculty called upon. The bashful man
hardly gets a chance. He is guyed until
he sits down. Indeed, there seems to
be an understanding between all the
boys not to allow any of the faculty to
speak. It is one huge laugh from start
to finish.</p>

<p>Time after time another man is called
upon to rise and express his opinions, or,
if he wishes, thank the boys for being
so good to him during the season. It's
no go. He might just as well sit down
and save his breath to cool his porridge.</p>

<p>The rest of the evening is given up to
yelling, shouting, singing and having a
generally jolly time.</p>

<p>Boys who are very wise have taken
the precaution to lock all their belongings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
up. Fear of burglars? No! A
general rough house is looked for on this
last night. For fun they will dump each
other's trunks or beds.</p>

<p>No one's property is sacred. You can
carefully lock your door, but if there is
a crevice large enough to let a spider in
they will crawl through that, turn your
room upside down, not leaving one article
in its place, then crawl out again,
leaving both door and window locked.
How could they have gotten in? No
one can tell.</p>

<p>We have serious thoughts of bidding
for a turret from some battleship and
using that as a room. Nothing lighter
would be of any use. It is long after the
usual hour for "Taps" to sound, and we
wonder why. The bugler is there, but
no bugle is to be found. Some boy has
hidden it. So on this, our last night in
Camp we have to depend upon the instructors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
who collect their boys, march
them to their tents and stay there, keeping
them company while they undress.</p>

<p>Most of them are really too tired to
try any games on the other tents, and
without any of the trouble we had anticipated
they are very soon ready for
the signal. As "Taps" cannot be blown
the whistle in the hands of the Director
is made to take its place.</p>

<p>One shrill blast and the lights go out.
"Good-night fellows, lots of fun going
home to-morrow."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Leaving Camp.</div>


<p>Bright and early they are all up and
dressed, only as anxious to be off as
they were to get here the beginning of
the season.</p>

<p>Long before there is any possibility
of the wagons coming for them they
stand, looking up the road, like sister
Anne in the story of Bluebeard.</p>

<p>Some of them are really ready. Most
of them are not. It is always at the
last moment that one finds most important
articles that ought to have been
snugly stowed away in the bottom of
the trunks, lying under the bed.</p>

<p>One boy is stuffing all his soiled
clothes in his rubber boots. Not such
a bad idea. You cannot make rubber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
boots go into a tiny little place, so may
as well fill them up.</p>

<p>Another is tearing everything out of
his trunk to repack it, having found that
there is no room on top for his blankets.
Still another solves his problem by
throwing away everything he thinks he
won't need for the winter. Whether
that suits his parents as well as it does
him history sayeth not.</p>

<p>How the average mother is able to
put such quantities of clothes and shoes
and sporting goods in that same trunk
before it left home and have room to
spare has always been a mystery to him.
Maybe if the mothers were to let the
boy himself do his packing, while they
looked on, it would teach the boy a good
practical lesson, and at the end of the
season prevent many a heartache.</p>

<p>By the time breakfast is over the wagons
begin to arrive. Those who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
ready make a wild dash for the best-looking
rig. "But not so quick, my
friend. You may as well climb out and
wait for your instructors, who are going
along with you. No need of crowding.
There is plenty of room for all."</p>

<p>Are they really so anxious to be off,
or is it just the last bit of Camp frolic?
At the same time, from previous experience,
my advice is to take it easy up to
a certain point. On this, our last day
in Camp don't let us neglect one thing
that we ought to do for the good of the
Camp, and yet while we are putting
everything in place, locking up all the
articles that ought to be locked, at the
same time you help half a hundred boys
to get their belongings together.</p>

<p>Tie one of the little boy's shoe laces,
lend another one a collar button, give a
safety pin to another, find a lost hat for
a third, put a bandage on a fourth, close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
up bags, open trunks, strap suit cases,
fetch, carry and help anywhere, any one,
anybody. Of course, you are going to
do all this. In your inmost heart you
hope you will be able to take one farewell
swim, and still have time to dress
like a civilized being, but nothing is certain
here.</p>

<p>Just as you decide to put the drugs
away and empty the bottles out so they
won't freeze during the winter, one of
the boys comes into the hospital to have
a cut dressed. "How on the face of the
earth did you do that? And on the last
day, too. Pity you could not remember
to cut yourself during office hours." His
excuse is that he found his pocket knife
that he thought he had lost, in his other
pants. Was so glad to see it that he
just opened it to see if it would cut. It
did.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>We wash the wound, tie it up and
shoo him out. Are we ever going to get
away?</p>

<p>We had always divided the season into
three periods, calling them as they
affected us, Mad, Glad and Sad.</p>

<p>Mad the first part, until everything
got into working order. Glad the second
part, because things were going
along all right, and Sad the last part, because
we hated to leave.</p>

<p>But to-day we have reversed it, and
the Sad is first; the Mad is last.</p>

<p>As I said a little while ago, my advice
up to a certain point is to take it easy,
but in order to do so you had better carefully
follow this recipe:</p>

<p>Take one horse, one wagon, one set
of harness and one whip. You can, if
you wish, separate them, or, if you have
room, leave them together. Watch your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
opportunity and hide them deep in the
woods, where they can keep cool and
quiet. When you are ready to use them
step very carefully up to the horse,
grasp the bridle and, jumping into the
wagon, with the whip in your hand,
drive off.</p>

<p>You might invite one or two of your
friends to go along, but be sure to leave
a seat for yourself.</p>

<p>We have often heard of people sprinting
for a wager, and we have been an
eye-witness of people who sprinted for a
train, because they stayed back too long.
Therefore, by following the above famous
recipe, you will find it digestible
and not hard to prepare.</p>

<p>Now, having left Camp at last, we
have another most beautiful ride
through shady roads, where the foliage
is turning all colors, where Nature with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
a most lavish paint brush is tinting the
maples, turning the apples into balls of
gold and red, causing the golden rod to
look like a golden border alongside the
road. What a riot of color! Wild
astors, gentian, foxgloves, everlasting
flowers shading from yellow to darkest
brown!</p>

<p>Summer still here, but autumn creeping
in a little further each day!</p>

<p>Every minute of that drive is pleasure.
We laugh. We sing. We joke with
each other. What good friends we have
all become! And yet how sad to think
that in a few short hours we may part,
perhaps never to meet again. Is it any
wonder that I, who have had many partings,
should feel sad? Is life only to be
made up of partings? Or are we to look
forward to happy meetings?</p>

<p>Who knows? Anyway, nothing is to
be gained by spoiling our last few hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
together. So again let us be merry and
bright, adopting for our motto, "Sufficient
unto the day is the evil thereof."</p>

<p>The farmers come to the doors of the
farm-houses to bid us good-bye and
Godspeed. The same motherly cows
stand looking at us with their serious
eyes. The same frisky calves run along
on the inside of the fence, a little older,
a little wiser, but still recognizing kindred
spirits among us, as when we travelled
this road a few short weeks ago.</p>

<p>How quickly the time has flown! It
is only impetuous youth who desires the
time to fly. In later years he dreads to
see it pass so quickly. If it is a long
lane that never has a turning, then ours
has been quite a long one. At last we
come in sight of the depot.</p>

<p>What a merry crowd! It is quite an
event to see us come and go, almost as
good as the circus, but much cheaper.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Any of the Campers who have any
change left are busily trying to get rid
of it. They don't mean to be caught
with any money on them when they get
home if they can help it. The druggist,
the fruit store, the candy shop, all get
their share, and when the train pulls in,
the boys can happily state that they have
only car fare left.</p>

<p>The ride on the train affords plenty
of enjoyment to old and young. The
passengers who are not Campers are
very much amused at the antics of those
that are.</p>

<p>When they were going to Camp, they
spent the hours before they got there
by saying all they were going to do;
now on leaving, they entertain each
other by retailing all the fun they have
had while there.</p>

<p>We get back to Portland in plenty of
time for supper.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Everything looks clean, dainty and
appetizing. The boys tuck in as though
they never knew when they were going
to get another square feed.</p>

<p>At last Nature, good old soul that she
is, cried, "Stop or take the consequences,"
and most of them did. One or
two who thought they had room for
just a little more stowed away enough
to give them a nice little stomach-ache,
which ought to have taught them better.</p>

<p>After supper we went aboard the
train, and settled ourselves comfortably
until it was time to start.</p>

<p>Our berths were assigned to us and,
as on our outward trip, the little shavers
were put together at one end of the
car in charge of instructors and Biddy.</p>

<p>Soon after we were all aboard, the
train drew out of the station. For some
little time, boys visited one another in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the different cars. Then the long-lost
bugle was discovered. The bugler was
summoned and ordered to blow "Quarters."
Every man Jack of them at once
obeyed, found out where he was to sleep
and in less than one hour, when Taps
were sounded, all were in bed.</p>

<p>For the last time the bugler stood in
turn in every car sounding Taps, the
porter ready to put the lights out. In
that narrow space it sounded very loud,
very clear and most beautiful.</p>

<p>"Good night, fellows; see you in the
morning. Don't forget to come up to
the house to-morrow night."</p>

<p>"Here, you, stop taking all the bed
clothes." "Oh, you chaps in that upper
berth, don't throw cracker crumbs
around."</p>

<p>"Please, sir, can we have the window
opened?" "Please, sir, can we have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
window closed?" Laughter, happiness
and teasing until the last one is asleep!</p>

<p>Throughout the long night nothing is
heard but the click of the rails as the
train drives on, the brakeman passing
through with his green and red lanterns,
the faithful instructors seeing that all
are covered, our beloved Director himself
looking out for the welfare of his
flock.</p>

<p>Biddy herself in her favorite corner.
But like an old mother hen who has
carefully brought up the families of several
other hens, now that her chickens
are able to scratch for themselves, and
when nightfall comes have wings strong
enough to fly to the top of the roost,
she feels she can stretch her legs, then
one wing, then the other, cramped by
long hovering, and with a sigh of complete
satisfaction close her eyes in sleep,
secure in the thought that "He who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
slumbers not nor sleeps" will watch and
protect her flock.</p>

<p>We still have to get dressed on the
train, and that is something to look forward
to.</p>

<p>Before daylight some of the boys are
up and about. It is of no use trying to
sleep any more, so we may as well tidy
ourselves up, wash our faces, if there
is any water, brush each other off, and
try and look just a bit tidy when we get
to the station.</p>

<p>Parents and friends will be so happy
to see us that they will forgive us, no
matter how wild and woolly we look.</p>

<p>To see such a company of tanned and
healthy boys is well worth coming to
the depot and waiting for belated trains.</p>

<p>As we hand over the last boy to his
folks, what a lot of satisfaction it affords
us to know and feel we have played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the game fair, and given every one a
square deal!</p>

<p>Once more we hear the Camp calls,
sounding strange here in the city. Good
byes are exchanged, thanks expressed,
hopes for another season, and at last
they have all been taken away from us.</p>

<p>We can go our way in peace, tracing,
with happy finger, the word that ends
our season's labor.</p>
